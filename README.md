# odin-recipes

This project creates a html script for a basic website that hosts recipes.

Things that were learned in this excercise was the ability to create boilerplate html files, creating links to different files, adding images, and ordered and unordered lists with other simple html properties.

The project contains 3 recipes that are linked to a home page.
