    <!-- Steps to make Peking Duck -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Rinse duck inside and out; pat dry. Cut off tail and discard.</li>

        <li>
            Mix together cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, white pepper, and cloves 
            in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon spice mixture into cavity of duck. 
            Stir 1 tablespoon soy sauce into remaining spice mixture and rub evenly 
            over entire outside of duck. Cut 1 green onion in half and tuck it inside 
            cavity. Cover and refrigerate duck for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
        </li>

        <li>
            Place duck breast-side up on a rack set in a wok or pot. Steam for 1 hour, 
            adding more water as it evaporates. Lift duck with two large spoons to drain 
            juices and green onion. Place duck breast-side up in a roasting pan and prick 
            skin all over with a fork.
        </li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Roast duck in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>
            Mix together remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce and honey in a small bowl. 
            Brush honey mixture onto duck.
        </li>

        <li>
            Increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Roast until 
            skin is richly browned, about 5 minutes. Do not allow skin to char.
        </li>

        <li>
            Mix together plum jam, chutney, sugar, and vinegar in a small serving bowl. 
            Chop remaining green onions and place them into a separate bowl.
        </li>

        <li>
            Place whole duck onto a serving platter and garnish with orange slices and 
            fresh parsley. Serve with plum sauce and chopped green onions.
        </li>
    </ol>
